  "Adaptive Self-Clocking Timeout Guard for CLJ/CLJS

  This implementation provides a cooperative timeout mechanism that can efficiently
  stop CPU-bound computations after a specified timeout period without requiring
  external watchdog threads or complex coordination.

  ## Overview

  The timeout guard uses an A* search-inspired adaptive algorithm that automatically
  adjusts how frequently it checks the system clock based on observed timing patterns.
  This minimizes the overhead when far from the timeout deadline while ensuring
  responsive detection near the timeout boundary.

  ## Key Algorithm Components

  ### Adaptive Stride-Based Sampling
  Instead of checking the clock on every call, the algorithm dynamically calculates
  a 'stride' - the number of calls to skip before the next time check. This stride
  is continuously adapted based on:
  
  - **EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average)**: Tracks mean time per step
  - **EWVAR (Exponentially Weighted Variance)**: Estimates timing variability  
  - **Decayed Maximum**: Hedges against occasional long steps that could cause overshoot
  - **Panic Mode**: Forces frequent sampling when time is being consumed too rapidly

  ### Target Overshoot Envelope
  The algorithm aims to detect timeouts within a bounded overshoot envelope:
  ```
  p99 overshoot ≤ max(S, min(5% × timeout, 10ms))
  ```
  where S is the p99 cost of a single atomic step between checks.

  ### Time-Based Ceiling
  To prevent excessively long periods without sampling, the stride calculation
  includes a time-based ceiling that ensures samples occur at least every 10ms
  of wall-clock time.

  ## Usage Pattern

  ```clojure
  (let [timeout? (make-timeout 200)]          ; 200ms timeout
    (reduce (fn [acc x]
              (if (timeout?)                  ; Check at natural boundaries
                (reduced acc)                 ; Return current value on timeout
                (expensive-step acc x)))      ; Continue processing
            initial-value
            large-dataset))
  ```

  ## Performance Characteristics

  - **Fast Path**: Simple counter increment and comparison (zero allocation)
  - **Sample Path**: Single monotonic time read plus statistical updates
  - **Steady-State Overhead**: Target <1-2% when far from deadline
  - **Cross-Platform**: Works on JVM, Node.js, and modern browsers

  ## Thread Confinement Model
  Each timeout guard is designed for single-threaded use (one guard per compute thread).
  Multiple guards can run concurrently in different threads without coordination.

  ## Constants and Tuning
  The algorithm uses fixed constants tuned for general-purpose workloads:
  - Z95 = 1.64485 (95th percentile multiplier for normal distribution)
  - ALPHA = 0.05 (EWMA/EWVAR smoothing factor)
  - SAFETY = 2.0 (conservative stride multiplier)
  - DECAY = 0.98 (decayed maximum decay rate per sample)
  - BURN_RATIO = 0.33 (panic threshold: >33% of remaining time consumed)

  These constants are intentionally not configurable to maintain API simplicity
  and ensure consistent behavior across deployments.")

;; ---------- Guard Protocol ----------

;; Guard State Management Protocol
;;
;; The Guard uses a protocol-based approach for field access to provide
;; better encapsulation while maintaining performance. All mutable fields
;; are accessed through getter/setter methods rather than direct field access.
;;
;; The Guard tracks both immutable configuration (deadline, target overshoot)
;; and mutable runtime state (timing statistics, stride calculations, debug counters).

   - EWMA-based p95 proxy using normal distribution assumption
   - Decayed maximum as a hedge against outlier steps  
   - Minimum floor of 1.0µs to prevent division by zero
   
   Returns the maximum of these three values."

(defn- calc-stride
  "Calculate adaptive stride for next sampling window.
   
   Determines how many timeout? calls to make before next time check.
   Uses two constraints:
   
   1. Budget-based: Allocates remaining time budget considering target overshoot
   2. Time-based ceiling: Ensures sampling at least every 10ms wall-clock time
   
   The stride is the minimum of these constraints, clamped between 1 and KMAX.
   Uses SAFETY multiplier for conservative estimation."

(defn make-timeout
  "Create an adaptive timeout guard function for cooperative CPU-bound computation limits.
  
   Creates a `timeout?` function that uses adaptive stride-based sampling to efficiently
   check if the specified timeout has been exceeded. The algorithm automatically adjusts
   its sampling frequency based on observed timing patterns to minimize overhead while
   ensuring responsive timeout detection.
   
   Arguments:
   - timeout-ms: Timeout duration in milliseconds (converted to microseconds internally)
   
   Returns:
   A timeout? function with two arities:
   - (timeout?)              => boolean  ; true means STOP NOW, false means continue
   - (timeout? :timeout/debug) => map     ; debugging information and statistics
   
   Usage Pattern:
   ```clojure
   (let [timeout? (make-timeout 200)]  ; 200ms timeout
     (reduce (fn [acc x]
               (if (timeout?)         ; Check at natural loop boundaries
                 (reduced acc)        ; Return current result on timeout

   ```
   
   Performance Notes:
   - Fast path: ~1-2ns overhead (counter increment + comparison)
   - Sample path: ~100ns overhead (time read + statistics)
   - Zero allocation on fast path
   - Adaptive sampling reduces checks when far from deadline
   - Target p99 overshoot: max(step_time, min(5% × timeout, 10ms))
